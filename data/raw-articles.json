A researcher at The University of Osaka has now explored a bold new approach: a gyroscopic wave energy converter that uses a spinning flywheel inside a floating structure to turn wave motion into electricity. By harnessing gyroscopic precession—the subtle wobble of a spinning object under force—the system can be tuned to absorb energy across a wide range of wave conditions.",

    "description": "A new scientific review challenges the headline-grabbing claim that Yellowstone’s returning wolves triggered one of the strongest trophic cascades on Earth. Researchers found that the reported 1,500% surge in willow growth was based on circular calculations and questionable comparisons. After correcting for modeling and sampling flaws, the supposed ecosystem-wide boom largely disappears.",

    "description": "A sweeping new study has uncovered a troubling mix of hazardous chemicals in popular hair extensions, including products made from human hair. Researchers detected dozens of substances linked to cancer, hormone disruption, reproductive harm, and immune system effects in nearly every sample tested. Some products contained flame retardants, organotins, and chemicals associated with increased breast cancer risk, and several exceeded European safety thresholds.",
