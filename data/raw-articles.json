Researchers found that physical activity prompts the liver to release an enzyme that removes a harmful protein causing the blood-brain barrier to become leaky with age. In older mice, dialing down this protein reduced inflammation and improved memory. The discovery points to a surprising body-to-brain pathway that could inspire new Alzheimer’s therapies.",

    "description": "A newly discovered bacterial duo may be the hidden cause of chronic constipation. The two microbes break down the colon’s protective mucus layer, leaving stool dry and hard — a problem traditional laxatives don’t fix. Parkinson’s patients, who often struggle with constipation years before tremors appear, have higher levels of these bacteria. Blocking the bacteria’s mucus-destroying enzyme prevented constipation in mice, hinting at a new treatment strategy.",

Now visual evidence suggests the problem is more extensive than previously known.\nAn investigation by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab first identified the bags in January, piling up around a factory that recycles toxic waste imported from the US.

The results suggest life was adapting to oxygen far earlier — and far more creatively — than once thought.",
