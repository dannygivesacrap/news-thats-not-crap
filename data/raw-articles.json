    "description": "Scientists have found compelling new evidence that humans, not glaciers, brought Stonehenge’s bluestones to the site. Using advanced mineral analysis, researchers searched nearby river sediments for signs glaciers once passed through the area—and found none. That missing signature strongly suggests the stones were intentionally moved by people. How they did it remains a mystery, but ice is now largely ruled out.",

    "description": "Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound can drive impressive weight loss, but stopping them is often followed by rapid weight regain. Researchers found that people regain weight faster after quitting these drugs than after diet and exercise alone. Improvements in heart health and diabetes risk also tend to reverse within a few years. The results suggest long-term success may require more than medication alone.",

    "description": "Cancer immunotherapy has been a game-changer, but many tumors still find ways to slip past the immune system. New research reveals a hidden trick: cancer cells can package the immune-blocking protein PD-L1 into tiny particles that circulate through the body and weaken immunotherapy’s impact. Scientists in Japan discovered that a little-known protein, UBL3, controls this process—and surprisingly, common cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins can shut it down.",
