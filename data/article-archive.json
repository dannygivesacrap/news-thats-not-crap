      "excerpt": "A new model has finally peeled back Jupiter's swirling storm clouds to reveal the planet likely holds significantly more oxygen than the Sun, providing key clues about how Jupiter and the rest of the solar system formed. The research also discovered that gases move through Jupiter's atmosphere much more slowly than scientists previously thought, reshaping our understanding of the solar system's largest planet.",

      "excerpt": "A new study comparing siblings across species found that humans belong in an elite \"league of monogamy,\" ranking closer to beavers and meerkats than to chimpanzees in terms of long-term pair bonding. Even in societies that permit polygamy, researchers discovered far more monogamous behavior than in most mammals, suggesting this rare evolutionary trait may have been key to human social success.",
